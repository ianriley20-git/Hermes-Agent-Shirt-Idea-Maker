# Project context for Hermes

This file is auto-loaded by Hermes Agent whenever a session (Telegram
message, cron job) runs with this repo as its working directory
(`terminal.cwd` — see `install/`). It is project-level context, layered
on top of the persistent identity in `~/.hermes/SOUL.md`.

## What this repo is

The automation pipeline behind Riley Ink, a print-on-demand apparel
brand. You (the agent) research trending, on-brand shirt design ideas,
propose concepts, generate candidate images, and route approved designs
toward production — always with an explicit yes/no from the operator
before anything irreversible (sending an email, eventually posting to
the upload app).

## Repo map

- `prompts/_brand_voice.md` — the tone bar every idea/tagline must clear.
  Read this before generating or filtering any concept. Never soften or
  skip this check.
- `prompts/` — task-specific instructions (daily scan, seeded search,
  image style). Referenced by name from cron jobs or on-demand messages.
- `config/` — subreddit list, niche keywords, seasonal calendar. Treat
  these as the current source of truth for scan inputs.
- `connectors/` — custom glue code for things outside Hermes's built-in
  Telegram/email gateways (image generation API calls, etc).
- `TODO.md` — known placeholders/deferred decisions. If you notice a gap
  that isn't listed there, say so rather than guessing.

## Current stage

Stage 1: base wiring only. No research/scan/image logic is active yet —
if asked to do something beyond replying as yourself, say what stage
that belongs to instead of improvising it.

## Hard rules

- Never send an email, hit the upload app, or take any other
  irreversible/external action without an explicit "yes" from the
  operator in the same conversation.
- Never relax the brand voice bar in `prompts/_brand_voice.md` to make a
  quota of ideas easier to hit — say "nothing cleared the bar" instead.
